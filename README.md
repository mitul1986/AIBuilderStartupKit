# AIBuilderStartupKit

This AIBuilder kit which is intended to help to start with all AI models including creating Flow powerapps and show AI capablity of AI builder to any related place 

AI Builder documentation is available here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder>

## Sample data for prediction

To help you get started quickly with prediction, use these three sample datasets. For information on how to import the sample data and use it in a prediction model, see [Data Preparation](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/prediction-data-prep) in AI Builder docs.

Please note that you do not need to download the CSV files, but rather link the raw URL of the CSV files during the data import flow.

### Online Shopper Intention

This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The prediction scenario is whether a customer will make a purchase using web analytics data from an online retailer.
-	**Solution**: AIBuilderOnlineShopperIntention_1_0_0_1_managed.zip 
-	**Data**: aib_onlineshopperintention.csv
 

### Steel Plates Fault

This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The prediction scenario is whether a stainless steel plate has a surface defect using indicators that approximate shape and reflective properties of the steel plate.
-	**Solution**: AIBuilderSteelPlatesFault_1_0_0_1_managed.zip
-	**Data**: aib_steelplatesfault.csv
